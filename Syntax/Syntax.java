/* Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. The class name should always start with an uppercase first letter. In our example, we named the class Main. 

Note: Java is case-sensitive. MyClass and myclass would be treated as two completely different names.

*/

package Syntax;

public class Syntax {
    
}

// Any code placed inside the main() method will be executed.

/*  For now, you don't need to understand the keywords public, static, and void. You will learn about them later in this tutorial. Just remember: main() is the starting point of every Java program.

Note: The curly braces {} mark the beginning and the end of a block of code.

System.out.println() may look long, but you can think of it as a single command that means: "Send this text to the screen."

Here's what each part means (you will learn the details later):

System is a built-in Java class.
out is a member of System, short for "output".
println() is a method, short for "print line".
Finally, remember that each Java statement must end with a semicolon (;).
